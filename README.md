# PyQt5TcpSerialComunicationPPK-
In this project ı aimed to get data from PPK2 module and printing on the console with tcp serial port and pushbutton
in this project you can create executiable file which can shows the current consumption at the same time send a current data to tcp port
but when you click to start you have to send a variable from lister to TCP port every time.
I made this project for test automation for Bluetooth Low Energy sensörs, this app take an 100000 samples for 1 second and finding average value for 10ms and
sends data for 20 seconds
You can change the color of buttons or you can remove the TCP

For executiable file you can write pip install auto-py-to-exe and auto-py-to-exe to the command prompt
